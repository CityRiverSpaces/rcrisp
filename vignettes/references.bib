  abstract = {Trafficking wet soils within and near stream and lake buffers can cause soil disturbances, i.e. rutting and compaction. This -- in turn -- can lead to increased surface flow, thereby facilitating the leaking of unwanted substances into downstream environments. Wet soils in mires, near streams and lakes have particularly low bearing capacity and are therefore more susceptible to rutting. It is therefore important to model and map the extent of these areas and associated wetness variations. This can now be done with adequate reliability using a high-resolution digital elevation model (DEM). In this article, we report on several digital terrain indices to predict soil wetness by wet-area locations. We varied the resolution of these indices to test what scale produces the best possible wet-areas mapping conformance. We found that topographic wetness index (TWI) and the newly developed cartographic depth-to-water index (DTW) were the best soil wetness predictors. While the TWI derivations were sensitive to scale, the DTW derivations were not and were therefore numerically robust. Since the DTW derivations vary by the area threshold for setting stream flow initiation, we found that the optimal threshold values for permanently wet areas varied by landform within the Krycklan watershed, e.g. 1--2 ha for till-derived landforms versus 8--16 ha for a coarse-textured alluvial floodplain.},

  abstract = {Comparisons between field data and available maps show that 64\% of wet areas in the boreal landscape are missing on current maps. Primarily forested wetlands and wet soils near streams and lakes are missing, making them difficult to manage. One solution is to model missing wet areas from high-resolution digital elevation models, using indices such as topographical wetness index and depth to water. However, when working across large areas with gradients in topography, soils and climate, it is not possible to find one method or one threshold that works everywhere. By using soil moisture data from the National Forest Inventory of Sweden as a training dataset, we show that it is possible to combine information from several indices and thresholds, using machine learners, thereby improving the mapping of wet soils (kappa\,=\,0.65). The new maps can be used to better plan roads and generate riparian buffer zones near surface waters.},

  abstract = {Topography, as captured by a digital elevation model (DEM), can be used to model soil moisture conditions because water tends to flow and accumulate in response to gradients in gravitational potential energy. A widely used topographic index, the soil wetness index (SWI), was compared with a new algorithm that produces a cartographic depth-to-water (DTW) index based on distance to surface water and slope. Both models reflect the tendency for soil to be saturated. A 1 m resolution Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) DEM and a 10 m conventional photogrammetric DEM were used and results were compared with field-mapped wet soil areas for a 193 ha watershed in Alberta, Canada, for verification. The DTW model was closer to field-mapped conditions. Values of Kmatch90 (areal correspondence, smaller values indicating better performance) were 7.8\% and 12.3\% for the LiDAR and conventional DEM DTW models, respectively, and 88.5\% and 86.7\% for the SWI models. The two indices were poorly correlated spatially. Both DEMs were found to be useful for modelling soil moisture conditions using the DTW model, but the LiDAR DEM produced the better results. All major wet areas and flow connectivity were reproduced and a threshold value of 1.5 m DTW accounted for 71\% of the observed wet areas. The poor performance of the SWI model is probably because of its over-dependence on flow accumulation. Incorporation of a flow accumulation algorithm that replicates the effects of dispersed flow showed some improvement in the SWI model for the conventional DEM but it still failed to replicate the full areal extent of wet areas. Local downslope topography and hydrologic conditions seemed to be more important in determining soil moisture conditions than is taken account of by the SWI. The DTW model has potential for application in distributed hydrologic modelling, precision forestry and agriculture and implementation of environmental soil management practices.},

  abstract = {Identifying floodplain boundaries is of paramount importance for earth, environmental and socioeconomic studies addressing riverine risk and resource management. However, to date, a global floodplain delineation using a homogeneous procedure has not been constructed. In this paper, we present the first, comprehensive, high-resolution, gridded dataset of Earth's floodplains at 250-m resolution (GFPLAIN250m). We use the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) digital terrain model and set of terrain analysis procedures for geomorphic floodplain delineations. The elevation data are processed by a fast geospatial tool for floodplain mapping available for download at https://github.com/fnardi/GFPLAIN. The GFPLAIN250m dataset can support many applications, including flood hazard mapping, habitat restoration, development studies, and the analysis of human-flood interactions. To test the GFPLAIN250m dataset, we perform a consistency analysis with floodplain delineations derived by flood hazard modelling studies in Europe.},

  abstract = {With increasing scarcity of natural resources, there is a need to provide resource managers and planners with maps that reliably inform about areas vulnerable to hydrological risks, including areas with ephemeral to intermittent flows. This paper demonstrates that the newly developed Wet-Areas Mapping (WAM) process using LiDAR-based point cloud data addresses some of these needs. This is done by portraying local flow patterns, soil drainage, soil moisture regimes and natural vegetation type across mapped areas in a numerically robust and consistent manner. As a result, WAM-derived maps are useful for surprise-free operations planning in several areas of natural resource planning (forestry, parks and recreation, oil and gas extraction, land reclamation), and also serve as field guides for locating and delineating flow channels, road-stream crossings, wet areas and wetlands.},
