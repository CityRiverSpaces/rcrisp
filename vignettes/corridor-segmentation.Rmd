For a more detailed analysis of an urban river corridor, corridor-level delineation may not be sufficient. The corridor needs to be subdivided into smaller morphological units. Segmentation is a process of subdividing the corridor by using major transversal road or rail infrastructure lines.

By default, the all-in-one function `delineate()` only returns the corridor boundary. The corridor can be segmented either by setting the argument `segments = TRUE` in `delineate()` or by using the `delineate_segments()` function in a separate step.

To demonstrate this as a separate step, we will use the `bucharest_delineation$corridor` from the package data, as well as `bucharest_osm$streets` and `bucharest_osm$railways` from the `CRiSpData` package as input.

We first prepare the network and select all the streets and railways that cover the river corridor plus a small buffer region (see also `vignette("network-preparation")`):

```{r network, warning=FALSE}
# Add a buffer region around the corridor
corridor_buffer <- sf::st_buffer(bucharest_delineation$corridor, 500)

# Filter the streets and railwayas to the buffer area
streets <- bucharest_osm$streets |>
  sf::st_filter(corridor_buffer, .predicate = sf::st_covered_by)
railways <- bucharest_osm$railways |>
  sf::st_filter(corridor_buffer, .predicate = sf::st_covered_by)

# Build combined street and railway network
network_filtered <- rbind(streets, railways) |>
  as_network()

```

We then delineate segments in the corridor. The algorithm spits the corridor using river-crossing transversal edges that form continuous lines in the network:

```{r segmentation, warning=FALSE}
segmented_corridor <- delineate_segments(bucharest_delineation$corridor,
                                         network_filtered,
                                         bucharest_osm$river_centerline)
plot(streets$geometry)
plot(segmented_corridor, border = "orange", lwd = 3, add = TRUE)
```
