\usage{
clip_and_filter(lines, corridor, river)
}
\arguments{
\item{lines}{Candidate segment edges as a simple feature geometry}

\item{corridor}{The river corridor as a simple feature geometry}

\item{river}{The river centerline as a simple feature geometry}
}
\value{
Candidate segment edges as a simple feature geometry
}
\description{
Lines that intersect the river and that cross the corridor from side to side
are considered valid segment edges. We group valid segment edges that cross
the river in nearby locations, and select the shortest line per cluster.
From these candidate segment edges, we select the ultimate set of
non-intersecting lines by dropping the longest segments with most
intersections.
